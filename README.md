# DEX

My decentralized exchange uses ERC20 tokens in order to trade DAI, BAT, REP and ZRX tokens. In this DEX you can create a limit order, which specify a max / min limit price for buy / sell order and a market order, where you agree to whatever price is on the market. Created with solidity, truffle, open zeppelin safe math, javascript and react.
